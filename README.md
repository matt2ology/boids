# Boids

Look at all them boids!

A simple implementation of the boids algorithm in Python.
Boids is a simple algorithm that simulates the flocking behavior of birds.
The algorithm was developed by [Craig Reynolds](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/index.html) in 1986.

The boids are displayed using the [`pygame`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/newbieguide.html) library.
